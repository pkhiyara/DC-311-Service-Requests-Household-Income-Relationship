    "I chose to use the median household income as my average measure of income since income is a skewed result as its distribution is not uniform and symmetrical but rather skewed to the right. Hence, it is a better measure of average household income in comparison to mean household income. As it can be obeserved from the graph above, there does seem to be a gradually increasing trend between Median Household Income (dollars) and Total Number of 311 Service Requests despite one huge outlier (Ward 3). Due to the large outlier, I would conclude that there is a moderate positive correlation, with a Pearson's r of 0.601, between median household income and Total Number of 311 Service Requests. This means that an association between average household income and service requests, though slightly weak, can generally be perceived from the graph's results. I believe the association is likely due to the fact that populations of wards with high median household income would generally pay more for their homes and live in more expensive neighborhoods. Hence, they may have higher expectations for their respective wards and as such, take up a greater responsbility in keeping their neighbourhood clean and fault-free by placing more 311 service request calls. Additionally, parking-related service requests makes up for a huge share of 311 service request calls and therefore, the relationship between median household income and 311 Service Requests may be better analyzed when specifically considering parking-related service requests alone."

    "<b>Analysis</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the Number of 311 Parking-Related Service Requests against Median Household Income in Washington D.C., it can be observed from the graph that there is a similar, moderate positive correlation with a Pearson's r of 0.563 between the variables as seen in the first graph. Once again, there is one huge outlier (Ward 3) that brings the overall correlation's strength down much like the first graph as well. A reason for why a positive correlation between parking-related service requests and median household income exists is that people living in wards with a lower median household income may not own or use cars, due to a car's expensive cost and their limited budget, and instead depend upon public transport for their transportation needs. Therefore, there would be a higher number of car owners living in wards with a higher median household income which would inevitably lead to a greater number of parking-related service requests among these wards too. This would also explain why the Median Household Income vs Number of 311 Non-Parking Service Requests scatterplot showed no correlation between the two variables since there was no clear economic reason behind why non-parking related service requests would positively correlate with median household income."

    "<b>Conclusion</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, it can be observed that while not exactly strong, there is a positive correlation between Total Number of 311 Service Requests and Median Household Income as well as between Number of 311 Parking-Related Service Requests and Median Household Income in Washington D.C. Meanwhile, there is no true correlation whatsoever between the Number of 311 Non-Parking Service Requests and Median Household Income in Washington D.C. Based on these observations, the positive correlation between the Number of 311 Parking-Related Service Requests and Median Household Income, regardless of how weak, can be explained by the fact that residents of higher median household income wards would generally own one or more cars in comparison to lower median household income wards whose residents would either not be able to afford a car, be unable to routinely maintain the cars they own, or generally prefer to travel using cheaper, public transportation methods such as the metro. As such, people living in lower income wards would place considerably fewer parking-related 311 service request calls in comparison to higher income ward residents. Furthermore, a potential reason for the weakness of the positive correlation could be due to the fact that this dataset is based on 311 service requests from Washington D.C. where traffic levels are generally high and public transport is used by many, regradless of income level or ward, on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Limitations</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of this study is that while the data presents ward demographic and economic data along with the number of service request calls per ward, it does not present this data over a large enough period of time for us to observe how the changes in economic data trends such as median household income of wards over a period of years impacts the number of 311 service requests placed per ward, whether parking-related or not, over the same period. Additionally, a confounding variable exists in this study in the form of the population density of each ward. As such, if a certain ward has a large population density, one would expect it to have more service requests (particularly parking related service requests) in comparison to other wards with smaller population densities."

    "<b>Data Source Citation and Explanation</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I used 2 datasets which were the 2014 311 City Service Requests and the 2011-2015 Wards dataset. The 2014 311 City Service Requests dataset was originally published by Washington DC's 311 Request Center (the Washington DC government in a broader sense) and it consists of numerous records of service requests, along with their issue type, that were made by each ward of the city during 2014. The dataset also includes additional information such as details describing the issue, indications of each request's urgency and when or if the request was resolved.\" Meanwhile, the 2011-2015 Wards dataset was found on Washington DC Government's Office of Planning website and it was originally published by the US Census Bureau based on information it regularly gathers on the US population through the American Community Survey. As such, this dataset consists of separate sheets for economic, housing, and demographic data from 2014 for residents of each ward within Washington DC. Moreover, each ward column has values for the point estimate value, margin of error, percent, and percent margin of error for each record within the datatset. In order to focus on finding an association between average household income and service requests during this project, I will only be using the point estimate values of the median and mean household income records for each ward from the economic data sheet within the 2011-2015 wards dataset.\n",
