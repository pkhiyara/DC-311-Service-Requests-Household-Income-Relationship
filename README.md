# DC 311 Service Requests & Household Income Relationship
A Python data manipulation and analysis project that examines the relationship between the number of 311 service request calls placed and the average household income of Washington D.C. residents, based on the eight wards that constitute the city, to find a potential correlation through the use of Pandas dataframe aggregations and Matplotlib visualizations.

For this project, I used 2 datasets which were the 2014 Washington D.C. 311 City Service Requests and the 2011-2015 Wards dataset obtained from the following sources:

* 2014 Washington D.C. 311 Service Requests dataset - https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/311-city-service-requests-in-2014
* 2011-2015 Wards dataset - https://planning.dc.gov/page/american-community-survey-acs-estimates
